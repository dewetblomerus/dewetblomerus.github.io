  <p>My name is De Wet Blomerus (sounds like "The Vet").</p>

    I am married to my best friend, Marysol.
    We are raising our three children and call Atlanta home.

    I'm an avid cyclist, audio book devourer, and burger connoisseur.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am a software professional who collaborates with business leaders to deliver products users
    love.
    I create value by planning, designing, developing, and delivering high-quality software.
    Understanding development best practices enables me to optimize the delivery process. I uniquely
    provide technical leadership and intentional mentorship to teams of software engineers.

    My expertise spans back-end development, cloud computing, data storage, and front-end. I
    specialize
    in technologies that increase programmer productivity, reduce development time, and maximize
    ROI.

    This is my <a href="blog">blog</a>. I only post sporadically.
    It focuses on all things code
    and sometimes the bigger picture around software creation.
